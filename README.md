# Marbles
__A custom Wordpress Theme for Teatro delle Biglie__

_Marbles_ ('Biglie') is a custom theme realized for Teatro delle Biglie, a student-run theatre association at [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it).

The theme is inspired on Caroline Moore's Spun Theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/spun), of which was originally a child theme. After a first release in such form, _Marbles_ is being ported to a newly written standalone theme based on [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/).

## License
The theme mainly addresses the needs of TdB; but if you think you can make something of this, I'm releasing this under the _[WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/)_. If you use it, let me know; if you improve it, you NEED to let me know ;)
