<h1>Marbles</h1>

<p><strong>A custom Wordpress Theme for Teatro delle Biglie</strong></p>

<p><em>Marbles</em> (&lsquo;Biglie&rsquo;) is a custom theme realized for Teatro delle Biglie (TdB), a student-run theatre association at <a href="http://polimi.it">Politecnico di Milano</a>.</p>

<p>The theme is inspired by Caroline Moore&rsquo;s Spun Theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/spun), of which was originally a child theme. After a first release in such form, <em>Marbles</em> is being ported to a newly written standalone theme based on <a href="http://themble.com/bones/">Bones</a>.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>The theme mainly addresses the needs of TdB; but if you think you can make something out of this, I&rsquo;m releasing this under the <em><a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">WTFPL</a></em>. If you use it, let me know; if you improve it, you NEED to let me know ;)</p>
