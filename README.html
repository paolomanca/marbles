<h1>Marbles</h1>

<p><strong>A custom Wordpress Theme for Teatro delle Biglie</strong></p>

<p><em>Marbles</em> (&lsquo;Biglie&rsquo;) is a custom theme realized for Teatro delle Biglie (TdB), a student-run theatre association at <a href="http://polimi.it">Politecnico di Milano</a>.</p>

<p>The theme is inspired by Caroline Moore&rsquo;s Spun Theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/spun), of which was originally a child theme. <em>Marbles</em> has since grown up and is no longer a child, it has been rewritten and made a parent.</p>
